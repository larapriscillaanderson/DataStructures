Data Structures Notes and Detailed Solutions

January 2, 2025

My name is Lara Priscilla Anderson and this is my Data Structures Notes Journal. My goal is to keep my academic knowledge of data
structures and algorithms compartmentalized and accessible so I can refer back to them at any time, even in my professional
career. I hope that this can also help anyone else who wants to become more disciplined and retain knowledge that would
otherwise be fleeting.
